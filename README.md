# EurexaBook
EurexaBook is a zero-configuration, cloud-based robotics simulation and development environment that connects the NVIDIA ecosystem, reduces development complexity, and provides high-performance GPU computing support.

## Key Features
1. Web-based IDE: Enables users to develop directly in the browser without requiring local installations.
2. Automated Development Environment Setup: Eliminates the complexity of setting up Mujoco, Isaac Labs, and other robotics simulation environments, offering a plug-and-play experience.
3. Mujoco Compatibility: Fully supports the Mujoco physics simulation engine, including integration with the dm_control library.
4. Mujoco Web Rendering and Interaction: Provides an interactive visualization of Mujoco simulations directly in the browser.
5. Third-Party GPU Integration: Allows cloud-based GPU computation to accelerate simulations and AI workloads.
6. Isaac Labs Compatibility: Seamlessly integrates with NVIDIA Isaac Labs, making it accessible via a web-based platform.
7. Isaac Labs Web Rendering and Interaction: Enables real-time Isaac Labs simulations and interactions through a web interface.
